# Roadmap

dpkr helix is developed against observable coding quality, security, and
workflow evidence rather than calendar promises. A planned item is not shipped
until its acceptance evidence passes, and a feature may be deferred when the
measured baseline shows that it would not improve a real outcome.

## Status guide

- **Shipped** — implemented and covered by the completed product baseline.
- **Next** — the first planned work unit; implementation has not started.
- **Planned** — accepted direction with an ordered dependency and proof owner.
- **Not committed** — an idea is outside the accepted roadmap until evidence
  and a concrete requirement justify it.

## At a glance

| Horizon | Status | Outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local coding baseline | Shipped | Approved project access, direct file and shell tools, reusable workspaces, project policies, handoffs, local-agent delegation, and live operations |
| Source distribution and hardening | Shipped | Source-based installation, public/private data boundary, security and contribution policies, dependency checks, and a reviewed public-release runbook |
| Measured Codex-quality parity | In progress | Make Web-plus-helix as dependable as local Codex on identical repository snapshots without weakening permissions, evidence truth, or existing work |
| Additional product expansion | Not committed | Add only capabilities justified by a measured parity failure or a concrete user requirement |

## Current program: measured Codex-quality parity

The program completed its baseline/configuration milestone. P01-P08 and their
deterministic snapshots are frozen; the current baseline, rejected medium and
High candidates, and metadata audit are recorded. Shared repository context is
the next milestone. Its
purpose is not to imitate the local Codex interface. It is to measure the same
coding tasks on the same repository snapshots and close proven gaps in
correctness, safety, review quality, and workflow continuity.

| Order | Milestone | User-visible outcome | Exit rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 — Complete | Baseline and configuration selection | Current `gpt-5.5` medium retained after same-snapshot medium, conditional-High, and metadata comparisons | Frozen suite and evidence-based selection recorded before product behavior changes |
| 2 — Complete | Shared repository context | Opened workspaces provide bounded, accurate repository context and a tree fingerprint | Prove clean, dirty, detached, non-Git, missing, and oversized cases without mutating index, checkout, or refs |
| 3 — Complete | Review and verification freshness | The model can distinguish fresh verification from stale or legacy evidence after files change | Prove fresh → stale → reverified transitions and preserve existing clients |
| 4 — Complete | Structured outcomes and questions | Codex can return completed, needs-input, or error outcomes without speculative edits and can continue the same thread after an answer | Prove persistence, restart behavior, same-session continuation, and provider compatibility |
| 5 — Complete | Bounded status waiting | One bounded status call can wait for completion or a question without duplicate execution | Prove terminal, input, error, stop, and timeout paths with zero duplicate workers |
| 6 — Next | Parity convergence | The complete same-snapshot suite, signed-in host workflow, security gates, and regressions agree | Mark the program complete only when Web-plus-helix has no additional mandatory failure |

The detailed requirements, failure behavior, task fixtures, and acceptance
criteria live in the canonical
[GOAL_08 Codex-Parity Coding Quality](./control-center/goals/GOAL_08_CODEX_PARITY.md)
contract. The ordered implementation record is
[08_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md](./control-center/08_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md).

## Decision rules

- No product feature begins before the baseline milestone closes.
- A feature is deferred if it does not improve mandatory task success, evidence
  truth, safety, or a repeatedly observed workflow cost.
- Lower latency, tool calls, tokens, or cost cannot compensate for a mandatory
  correctness, permission, secret-handling, or stale-evidence failure.
- Existing owners are extended before adding a dependency, service, store,
  daemon, queue, or parallel source of truth.
- “Better than local Codex” may be claimed only for the measured suite and
  tested configuration; a general superiority claim requires broader repeated
  evidence.

## Not currently committed

The accepted roadmap does not currently include a generic plugin system,
multi-agent planner, autonomous background orchestration, browser extension,
desktop wrapper, cloud source mirror, or second execution engine. These are not
permanently forbidden, but they require a current user need and direct evidence
that the existing owners cannot satisfy it.

## How this document stays accurate

This page is the public summary, not a second planning authority. Status changes
must be backed by implementation and verification, then synchronized with the
canonical Goal, Project State, and Handoff. Roadmap changes do not silently
promise a release date, hosted service, paid plan, or host capability.
